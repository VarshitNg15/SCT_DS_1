SCT_DS_1: Data Analysis and Visualization Breakdown

This script conducts a thorough examination and visualization of a population dataset through the following steps:

1. Loading the Dataset:
     Imports the dataset from a CSV file (`API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_5871594.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. Preliminary Data Review:
     Displays the initial four rows of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

3. Data Cleaning Procedures:
     Applies forward-filling (`ffill`) to address missing values, ensuring continuity in data.
     Identifies and reports any remaining missing values and duplicate entries.
     Removes non-essential columns (`Indicator Name`, `Indicator Code`, `Country Code`) to refine the dataset for analysis.

4. Histogram Analysis:
     Generates histograms for each year’s data to analyze population distribution:
     Plots histograms for each year (excluding `Country Name`) with 7 bins.
     Labels each histogram appropriately with the year, frequency, and a descriptive title.

5. Aggregate Yearly Distribution:
     Creates a combined histogram to illustrate the distribution of population values across all years:
     Overlays histograms for different years with transparency (`alpha=0.5`) to facilitate comparison.
     Adds x-axis and y-axis labels, a title, and a legend to the plot for clarity.

6. Country Selection and Sorting:
     Sorts the DataFrame by population values for 1960 and identifies the top 7 countries with the smallest populations for that year.

7. Data Transformation for Visualization:
     Transforms the DataFrame by setting `Country Name` as the index and transposing it for year-wise plotting:
     Creates transposed DataFrames, `country1960T` and `country2022T`, with `country1960T` not used further in this script.

8. Country-Specific Trends:
     Produces bar plots for each country to visualize population changes from 1960 to 2022:
     Iterates through each country’s data to generate bar plots with years on the x-axis and population values on the y-axis.
     Includes detailed labels, titles, and rotates x-axis labels for better readability.

This approach provides a detailed analysis of population trends and distributions, utilizing a range of visualizations to gain insights into historical and contemporary population data.
